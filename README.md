# AdGuard VPN Desktop

#### ⚠️ This is NOT an official AdGuard VPN app

A desktop wrapper for [AdGuard VPN CLI](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardCLI).

Was designed to simplify some common VPN operations, so features are limited:

- Connect/disconnect
- Location select
- Exclusions

## Installation

### Pre-built binaries

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/downace/adguardvpn-desktop/releases) page

### Manual build

1. Install Wails CLI: https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Run `wails build`

## Known issues

- Connection requires root permissions. Currently, password should be entered in terminal
